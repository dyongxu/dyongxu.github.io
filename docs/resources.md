## For Designers

**Fiori Moments Sketch File**<br>
These stencils help you create your own designs for empty and success states. They provide a realistic visualization of Fiori Moments within various UI components. For more detailed information around how and when to use a specific illustration or illustration type, please refer to our [online guidance](https://github.tools.sap/sap-design-ops/fiori-moments/wiki/Guidance-for-Fiori-Moments-and-Messaging).

This sketch file includes all illustrations available. This version covers vertical-centered layouts for Fiori moments only. Future releases will expand the designs to cover horizontal layouts for more flexibility. There are 12 empty states and 1 success states in total. Each use case is paired with recommended messaging. For more information around how to craft friendlier and more useful messages, please visit our [messaging framework](messaging-framework).

To create Fiori app screens you will also need the [72 type family](https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2020615116) and the [SAP icon set](https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/visualcore/Icons). Both can be found with the [SAP Fundamentals kit](https://sap.github.io/fundamental/resources/ui-kit.html) along with Fiori 3 components and screens.

::: warning NOTE
The design stencils are high-fidelity mock-ups for use in your designs. They should **not** be used as specifications for development. The illustrations placed in the stencils are for-placement-only PNGs and should not be used for implementation. For implementation, please use SVGs as provided in our [Github repo](https://github.tools.sap/sap-design-ops/fiori-moments).

## For Developers
SVG, HTML, and CSS code have been created to aid implementation. You can find examples of all illustrations available on the [Illustration Library](library.html) with code snippets. Refer to the Github repo for details on integrating the code into your application.
