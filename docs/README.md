# Introduction

## Overview

A primary goal of Fiori is to create a clear and consistent user experience across all SAP applications. Beyond that, we want to make the user experience more enjoyable and meaningful, to create a deeper connection with our users. The following tools help us do this:

- Fiori’s personality: Who we are.
- Voice and tone: What we say and how we say it.
- Fiori Moments: Recommended combinations of images and messages to help you create your own.

Let’s take a look at these one at a time…

## Personality

What is Fiori’s personality? _Who are we_? 
We help our users run at their best by showing them what’s possible. We are insightful, professional, and friendly. Small moments of delight are good, but never at the expense of helping users get their work done. We are relatable, smart, encouraging and trusted:

## Voice and Tone

When incorporating personality into your product’s messaging, you need to consider the two key aspects that provide a sense of personality: voice and tone.

**Voice:**<br>
Our voice expresses the core of our product personality and SAP’s values. Our voice is always consistent. It is affected by the topics we choose to talk about, the details we choose to focus on, and the words we use to express our ideas. Generally speaking, voice is the ‘what’ aspect of the conversation.

*For example, imagine a confirmation message: “Application successfully generated report.” In our Fiori voice, this would be something with less jargon and a more conversational style that considers the user’s perspective, such as “Your report has been created.”*

**Tone:**<br>
While voice is always consistent, tone varies depending on the context, the product, and the audience. Tone is the mood or attitude you present to the user. It’s the ‘why’ and ‘how’ of the conversation. In a way, tone is the emotional content of the personality, expressing happiness or concern depending on the situation. As with real-life conversations, your tone changes depending on who you’re talking to. It’s the same in your product messaging: if you’re talking to casual end users, you can have a lighter tone than if you’re addressing management.

*For example, our “Your report has been created.” message might work fine for an experienced user who creates reports all day and just wants a confirmation message to tell them when the report is ready. But for a user creating a report on their phone, we might adopt a more celebratory tone, such as “Nicely done. You created a report!”*

To properly express Fiori’s personality, it’s important to provide a consistent voice and tone across the product’s messaging.

## Fiori Moments

*Fiori moments* are expressions of the Fiori personality, translated into a distinctive visual language that combines custom illustrations, solution-oriented messaging, and a conversational tone. These guidelines provide everything you need to create Fiori moments that will improve the experience users have with our products.
