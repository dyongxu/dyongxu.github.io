# Illustration and Messaging Guidance

## Empty States

Empty states are moments in a user’s experience when there is nothing to display. They can occur because of an error; when there is no data available; after a transaction is completed; or for a first time user interaction (such as on-boarding).

**Guidance**<br>
Empty states present an opportunity to engage with users and provide guidance for what to do next. They can be used to educate them about a situation or app. It’s also a great opportunity to inject personalty and connect humanly with users.

> General approach: When an empty state occurs, guide the user in how to populate the screen with content or, if an error, how to recover from it. Always give the user a next step (via a link or button, if possible)

## Success States

A success state is a way to let a user know when they’ve accomplished a task or where they are in achieving a goal. Success Moments (illustration with message) are meant to celebrate and reward users’ special accomplishments or after performing an important task.

> General approach: Success Moments should only be used in notable positive situations. Be certain that the user will not encounter multiple Success Moments using this tone over a short period of time. If a Success Moment appears too often, and for small everyday tasks, users may feel the product is disingenuous (and we want to build trust!) For a more moderate positive situation, we recommend the check-mark with or without the confetti expression marks. These can be used more regularly (examples: new feature announcement; wizard flows etc.)

## Positive and Negative Situations

A Fiori Moment is an opportunity to turn any situation (even a negative one) into a better experience for our users.

- Positive situations should be conversational and upbeat in tone.
- Negative situations (such as data loss, for example) should be more straightforward but should not have a negative tone. These situations should be treated as educational opportunities to guide the user through the pain-point they are experiencing. The messaging and illustration should communicate what the user needs to know, followed by guidance for next steps. Errors without solutions should explain what went wrong so the user can attempt to troubleshoot. If possible, provide them with a troubleshooting step (like refreshing the page or returning later).

## When and How to Use

<u>When do you need a Fiori moment?</u><br>
*Consider the following*

- Fiori moments help the user understand what is going on, telling them why they are seeing a message and what to do next. Empty states should never feel empty. Typical scenarios include: First time user/on-boarding; User-cleared states; No results; Error state.
- Each Fiori moment must have a message: a headline and body text (with details that engage users).

<u>When should a Fiori moment include an illustration?</u><br>

- When appropriate, an illustration paired with messaging should be used to help clarify a situation. Not all Fiori moments require an illustration but it is a great way to add personality, convey meaning and visual interest.
- If an illustration does not enhance the situation, don’t use it. (Examples: controls with embedded components; areas serving up multiple empty states at once)

<u>How should the message and illustration work together?</u><br>

- Make sure the message, call to action, and illustration clarify the situation as one complete thought.
- Never use an illustration without a message. The two together convey a deeper meaning than alone.
- Follow the layout and spacing specification (see [Resources](resources) for downloable files)

## Composition/Layout

**Typography:**<br>
We follow the Fiori 3 type guidelines for header and subhead text. All use typeface ’72’.

**Illustration:**<br>
Illustrations are always paired with a message. There are no exceptions.

**Grids and Spacing**<br>
We follow the Fiori 3 grid and spacing guidelines.

**Components and Layout Specs**<br>
Fiori Moments live within Fiori UI components such as Cards (or card-like containers), Dialogs and Full screen situations. Always follow the layout and spacing specifications provided here. See the [Resources](resources) section to download the Fiori Moments Layout Sketch file for comps and mock-ups.

Best Practices:<br>
**Do** use pre-made compositions.<br>
**Do not** hack illustrations or modify what we have created. As we expand our library, we will also plan a contribution model that scales to your needs.<br>
**Do** use illustrations in the specified size and format.<br>
