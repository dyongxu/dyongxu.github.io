# Illustration Style

## Overview
Product illustrations convey an idea visually, and help to create an emotional connection between our end users and our products. We have taken the qualities of our personality and translated them into a distinctive illustration style that is true to our tone of voice.

## Illustration Principles

**Be Helpful**<br>
Our Illustrations help users to better understand a concept or situation in a visual way. They are meant to clarify, *not* to steal the spotlight.

*Stylistically, they are simple and light, complementing the surrounding UI and color palette. They should never distract the user from getting their work done.*

**Be Relatable**<br>
We want to show that we are empathetic and value our users. Our illustrations strive to be inclusive, meaning all ages, races, genders, and types of users, should understand and connect with the message.

*Our illustrations use lines and symbols to express emotion and suggest movement. Their style is more organic and approachable. They help us tell stories that people can relate to*.

**Be clear**<br>
Our illustrations help clarify meaning by providing visual reinforcement for the messages.

*We avoid telling multiple stories in one illustration and try to be as direct and literal as possible. We use metaphor, when appropriate, to help convey more complex concepts.*

## General Styling

**Color:**<br>

Our color palette was chosen carefully with theming in mind. It is based on the Fiori primary colors to complement the Fiori UI and maintain consistency across applications. For a bit of visual interest, we added the SAP brand gold color as a nod to our corporate brand values.

<u>Color Balance:</u><br>
We generally refrain from using too much color in our illustrations. Color is great but we are selective about how and when it is used. The illustrations should complement the UI, not draw too much attention to itself.

**Strokes:**<br>
<u>Stroke Breakdown:</u><br>
We use 1pt for stroke weight in all of our illustrations. It works well in various sizes and allows us to create pixel perfect assets.

<u>Stroke Caps:</u><br>
We use rounded cap and rounded corners in our illustrations. We find they make the illustrations appear more friendly and approachable.

**Patterns:**<br>
<u>Usage:</u><br>
Patterns are applied as a highlight or shadow to indicate depth â€” they are never used as a primary focus. They help to make the illustrations more interesting and distinctive.

<u>Perspective:</u><br>
Our illustrations point of view is from the front or top. We avoid creating objects in perspective or in isometric view.

<u>Background:</u><br>
Backgrounds or grounding elements are used for scene and dialog illustrations. The background shapes vary but are always rounded and abstract. The backgrounds help seat bigger illustrations within the UI.
